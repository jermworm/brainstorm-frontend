# Brainstorm v1.x
Brainstorm is a project management system designed to help individuals get their project thoughts and ideas together on the fly. With the option to add collaborators users never have to work alone.

Brainstorm in v1.x stages will primarily be focused on the core features of creating a project, and adding quick ideas with the ability to directly invite via email other collaborators who do not have to sign up. 

users can create a project as well as add ideas without being registered, however the information does not persist or save to the backend unless user is registered and logged in.
